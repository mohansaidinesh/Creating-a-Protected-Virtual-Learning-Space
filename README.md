# Abstract

The pandemic has significantly impacted meeting arrangements, with online meetings becoming increasingly popular. Video conferencing systems and communication tools have facilitated this trend, reducing travel expenses and time. Online classrooms have become an alternative to traditional face-to-face instruction, allowing students to continue their education without disruption. However, security concerns have increased due to the increasing popularity of online platforms. This study proposes a comprehensive strategy for improving security and user experience in online education, utilizing authentication mechanisms, user behavior analysis, network monitoring, and machine learning algorithms to validate participant identities, differentiate legitimate users, restrict unauthorized access, and promote courteous conversation.
